    <h1>Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Standards for rdx for Reddit</h1>
    <p>rdx for Reddit is committed to maintaining a safe platform and upholding the highest standards to prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). Our app is designed solely for browsing public Reddit content, and it does not permit user account creation, content posting, or direct user engagement, which significantly reduces the risk of CSAE-related activity.</p>

    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We strictly prohibit any form of child sexual abuse and exploitation on our platform. Any content or behavior that involves the sexual exploitation, abuse, or endangerment of children is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.</li>
        <li>Although user engagement is disabled, we maintain vigilance to ensure that the content accessible through our app complies with all relevant laws and platform policies concerning child safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Content Monitoring and Reporting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Since our app only allows viewing of publicly available Reddit content, we rely on Redditâ€™s existing policies and mechanisms to address any child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or CSAE concerns.</li>
        <li>We encourage users to report any suspicious or harmful content directly to Reddit, which has dedicated resources and policies to handle such reports.</li>
        <li>Our app also provides an easy in-app feedback mechanism for users to confidentially share concerns or report inappropriate content that may be encountered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We comply with all applicable child protection laws and regulations.</li>
        <li>We commit to cooperating fully with law enforcement and relevant authorities if any CSAE issues connected to our app are identified.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Point of Contact</h2>
    <p>For any concerns or inquiries regarding child safety, CSAE prevention, and compliance with our standards, please contact:</p>
